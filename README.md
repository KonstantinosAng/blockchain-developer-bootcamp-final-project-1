### Ether donate or not

<p>An Ethereum based platform where a user (let's call him a Visioner) can post his idea/vision/project for something and define the amount of capital he needs to achieve it.
Other users can invest.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Visioner can upload his vision and check its status and the capital amount collected.</li>
  <li>Users can invest to one or more ideas and browse through a list to available ones.</li>
  <li>Once the requested capital is achieved, no more investments are being accepted.</li>
  <li>If the requested amount is not completed, the funds are returned.
</ul>

### Available Actions

</ul>

#### Vision Owner

<ul>
  <li>After the amount goal is reached:</li>

    </ul>
</ul>

#### Vision Investors
